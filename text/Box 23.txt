Creating Your Own OGRE Meshes

To create your own meshes you will need to use what is known as a 3D modeling program. This type of program will allow you create a model using a three dimensional display. This allows you to see a realtime updated preview of your model from any angle during the creation process. This type of program also provides tools to allow you to add image textures, to give your model a graphical skin for when it’s rendered in the 3D engine. More advanced 3D modeling programs allow you precisely to align image textures to a model by un-wrapping the model into a 2D form. This two dimensional unwrapped form can then be exported as an image to provide a template from which you can draw your texture. When this texture is applied back onto the original 3D model, it will match the 3d shape perfectly. Any 3D modeling program can be used to create your 3D models as long as the finished model can be exported and saved as a ‘*.mesh’ file, OGRE’s native file format.
