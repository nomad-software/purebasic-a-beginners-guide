The Core Language

In this section, we will study the PureBasic language itself. I call this part 'The Core Language', because our focus will be on the essentials of PureBasic programming: its built-in types, statements and expressions. By the time you finish reading this section and studying the examples, you'll be ready to write programs yourself.

The word 'Core' in the title is used on purpose, because this section is not an exhaustive document on every minute detail of PureBasic. While I may skip certain things along the way, the basics you learn here will stand you in very good stead for when the unknown pops up. There is also a mention of the history and development philosophy of PureBasic for those who are interested.
