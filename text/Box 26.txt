Testing Command Line Parameters Using The IDE

When developing an application in the IDE that will accept command line parameters, you don't really want to be compiling to a final executable and calling that through a command line interface every time you want to test it. Instead of this long process, the PureBasic IDE helps you out by providing a field where you can enter command line parameters that you want to pass to your program when you compile it. This field can be found in the 'Compiler Options' window, which is accessible from the 'Compiler' menu. If you look three quarters of the way down you will see the field marked 'Executable Commandline'. This is where you enter parameters that you would like passing to your program when you hit the 'Compile/Run' button. Try entering some parameters in there to test the examples in this section.
