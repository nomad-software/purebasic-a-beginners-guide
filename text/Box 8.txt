Strictly Passing Values To Procedures

When calling a procedure you must make sure that any defined parameters are called using the correct types or you will raise a syntax error when compiling. For example, if a procedure is defined as this:

AddTogether(a.l, b.l)

then only Long variables must be passed as parameters. If String type variables are defined as parameters then you must call the procedure using Strings as values for these parameters. Procedures using arrays and linked lists as parameters must also be called correctly and all parameters must be in the correct order and using the correct type. I know this seems obvious but I think it's worth pointing out.
