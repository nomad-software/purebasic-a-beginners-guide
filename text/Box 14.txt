Defining Variables Using The ‘Define’ Command

The ‘Define’ command can be used in two ways. First it sets the default type for un-typed variables, as shown in Chapter 2. In this way the ‘Define’ keyword is used with a type suffix which defines the new default type, like this:

Define.s
MyString = "Hello"

Secondly, the ‘Define’ command can be used to define variables after an ‘EnableExplicit’ command has been used. If the ‘EnableExplicit’ command has been used, all variables from then on in your program have to be strictly defined. In this case, the ‘Define’ command may be used like this:

EnableExplicit
Define MyVar.b = 10

Notice that when used in this way you don’t have to use the type suffix on the end of the ‘Define’ keyword because we define the variable type using the variable’s own type suffix instead.
