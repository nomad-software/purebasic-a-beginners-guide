DLL Calling Conventions

When using PureBasic there are two calling conventions that may be used with DLLs. As standard PureBasic assumes that any given DLL uses the 'stdcall' calling convention and that any DLLs created using PureBasic via the 'ProcedureDLL' keyword are also considered to be using the 'stdcall' calling convention. This convention is used as standard in PureBasic because it is the standard calling convention of Microsoft Windows.

If needed though, the 'cdecl' calling convention can be used by using the complementary 'C' functions from the PureBasic 'Library' group of commands. For example, instead of using the 'ProcedureDLL' keyword to create a 'stdcall' DLL procedure you can make that procedure use the 'cdecl' calling convention by using the 'ProcedureCDLL' keyword instead. The same goes for calling procedures from DLLs. Instead of calling a 'stdcall' procedure using the 'CallFunction()' command, you can call a 'cdecl' procedure using the 'CallCFunction()' command.

There are more of these complementary 'C' functions available to be used in PureBasic, look at the helpfile in the 'Library' section for a complete list.
