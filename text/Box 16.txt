Differences Between Graphical And Non Graphical Console Modes

Using the 'EnableGraphicalConsole()' command you can switch between text mode and graphical mode of the current console. Here are the differences for each mode:

Text Mode (Default):
ASCII control characters work correctly (ASCII range '0' to '31').
Output redirection using Pipes works correctly (Essential for CGI programs).
Long Strings of printed text wrap onto a new line if they reach the end of the console window.
You can read and write data to the console that is not necessarily text based.

Graphical Mode (Changed using 'EnableGraphicalConsole(#True)'):
Text characters outside the ACSII range '33' to '126' are displayed as small simple graphics.
Long Strings of printed text are truncated if they reach the end of the console window.
'ClearConsole()' clears the entire console of any output.
'ConsoleLocate()' Moves the cursor to be able to print text in any position in the console window.

This list contains some advanced topics you might not be familiar with right now but I have included this list here to be used a future reference when you are more comfortable with these things.
