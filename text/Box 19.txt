Why Can't I Put Icons In Menus?

You will probably notice in Fig.30 that there are icons in the PureBasic IDE's menus but there are no native commands included in PureBasic for putting icons in menus. PureBasic is a cross-platform programming language and PureBasic code, once written, should compile for any supported platform. Therefore, all supported commands must achieve the same desired effect on each platform. Icons in menus were regarded as being too difficult to support in a cross-platform way so they were omitted, from the final PureBasic command set. The icons included in the PureBasic IDE were coded using each platform's native API (Such as the WinAPI in the case of Microsoft Windows). To learn more about what a native API is and learn more about the WinAPI, see Chapter 13.
