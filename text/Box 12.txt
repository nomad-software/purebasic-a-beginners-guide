The 'CloseFile()' Command Is Very Important

When you have finished reading and especially writing to files you must close the file correctly using the 'CloseFile()' command. This command not only closes the selected file but frees it up again to be opened by another program if needed. Another important role that the 'CloseFile()' command plays is that it completely writes to the file any data that has been left in the file buffer. PureBasic uses a buffer system to increase performance of file access, so if you are open a file in another editor and some data you expected to be there is missing you must check that you've closed the file properly using 'CloseFile()'. This command ensures any data remaining in the file buffer is written to disk.

The file buffers are completely transparent to the regular user, so you won't have to worry about them too much, you just need to close each file when you have finished with it to avoid any errors.
